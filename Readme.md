# Neural Network for XOR Problem in C++

This project implements a simple neural network in C++ to solve the XOR problem. The neural network consists of:
- An input layer with 2 neurons
- One hidden layer with 2 neurons
- An output layer with 1 neuron

## Features

- Random initialization of weights and biases
- Sigmoid activation function
- Forward and backward propagation
- Training using gradient descent
- Output printing after every 5000 epochs up to 25000 epochs

## Code Overview

### NeuralNetwork Class

The `NeuralNetwork` class contains the following methods:

- **Constructor**: Initializes weights, biases, and learning rate.
- **sigmoid**: Computes the sigmoid activation function.
- **sigmoid_derivative**: Computes the derivative of the sigmoid function.
- **train**: Trains the network using forward and backward propagation.
- **predict**: Predicts the output for given inputs.

### Main Function

The `main` function:
1. Initializes the neural network with a learning rate of 0.1.
